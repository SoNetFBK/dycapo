Dycapo 0.0.1 is just for _showing_out_some_functionalities_ of the system and 
testing the underlying technologies. 
Dycapo 0.0.1 incorporates and shows:
- OpenTrip Core adoption and OpenTrip Dynamic data structures proposal (in Django Model format)
- Use of XML-RPC with Django (rpc4django over HTTP and HTTPS)
- (Sort of) integration of Dycapo models with Django and rpc4django
- Authentication
- Insertion of a trip by a driver
- Start of a trip by a driver
- Search of a trip by a rider
- Accepting a ride

No one exported XML-RPC function will surely be included in the final API!
No one exported XML-RPC function is either optimized or completely working!

Code is (somewhat) documented. Expect a completely better work for 0.1.0 :)
