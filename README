INTRODUCTION
***************

Dycapo (a.k.a. DyCaPo - Dynamic CarPooling) is a free software system 
developed in the SoNET <http://sonet.fbk.eu> unit of the Fondazione Bruno Kessler <http://fbk.eu>

It is an open client (mobile) / server system that will improve travel experiences 
of people in a city. The system will let people to define a destination on their
mobile phone. 
Dycapo will suggest and arrange trips by either using the Public Transport Service
or Carpooling volunteers.

That is, Dycapo will implement full Dynamic Carpooling functionalities 
as well as static approaches.

The system will be first thought, implemented and tested for the city of Trento, Italy. 
As the implementation continues and succedes, the whole national territory could be served.

It is currently a solo project started by Daniel Graziotin for his BSC thesis 
at the Free University of Bolzano/Bozen.
