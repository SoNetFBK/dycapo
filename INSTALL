MEET THE DEPENDENCIES
***************

Please verify that your system meets all the dependencies described in
DEPENDENCIES file.

Please note that we are testing Dycapo using Mysql. We also provide a dump, 
located under db/dycapo-mysql.sql that enables testing out-of-the-box


ADJUST SETTINGS.PY
***************

Adjust settings.py according to your needs. In particular, change the values of:
- ADMINS
- DATABASE_* (all of them)
- MEDIA_ROOT
- ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX
- GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
- SITE_DOMAIN (use domain.ext or subdomain.domain.ext, without HTTP)
- TEMPLATE_DIRS

Run
python manage.py syncdb

We provide 8 registered users to test DycapoS functionalities:
- admin
- driver1
- rider1
- rob
- dio
- ozzy
- angela

All of them with password set to "password".

We provide a testing framework, located under tests/.
We are using py.test <http://codespeak.net/py/dist/test/>.
To run all tests, simply run run_tests.py

ADJUST DYCAPO.WSGI
***************
It should work as it is but have a look at it. It's in the
apache folder

CONFIGURE APACHE
***************
Dycapo is designed and thought for using it with Apache2, and served with
mod_wsgi.
Authentication is based on basic access authentication (on HTTP and HTTPS)

We highly reccommend to use HTTPS instead of HTTP, because of the private
information exchanged between Dycapo and the clients.

Please see docs/apache_conf/000-default for an example of a VHost configuration for Apache under Ubuntu
