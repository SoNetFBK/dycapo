MEET THE DEPENDENCIES
***************

Please verify that your system meets all the dependencies described in
DEPENDENCIES file.

Right now we could just test Dycapo using Sqlite.

ADJUST SETTINGS
***************

Adjust settings.py according to your needs. In particular, change the values of:
- ADMINS
- DATABASE_* (all of them)
- MEDIA_ROOT
- ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX
- GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY

Run
python manage.py syncdb

We provide 3 registered users to test Dycapo functionalities:
- admin 
- driver1
- rider1

All of them with password set to "password".

CONFIGURE APACHE
***************
Dycapo is designed and thought for using it with Apache2, and served with
mod_wsgi. It uses rpc4django <http://www.davidfischer.name/rpc4django/> to 
handle XML-RPC requests and responses. 
Authentication is based on basic access authentication (on HTTP and HTTPS)
Authentication is also handled by auth.wsgi file. Other authentication systems
will not work, even the classical Django admin login.
We highly reccommend to use HTTPS instead of HTTP, because of the private
information exchanged between Dycapo and the clients.

Please see docs/httpd.conf and docs/sites-enabled for some examples of 
basic Apache2 configuration for Dycapo.
