MEET THE DEPENDENCIES
***************

Please verify that your system meets all the dependencies described in
DEPENDENCIES file.

Right now we could just test Dycapo using Sqlite.

ADJUST SETTINGS.PY
***************

Adjust settings.py according to your needs. In particular, change the values of:
- ADMINS
- DATABASE_* (all of them)
- MEDIA_ROOT
- ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX
- GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
- SITE_DOMAIN (use domain.ext or subdomain.domain.ext, without HTTP)
Run
python manage.py syncdb

We provide 3 registered users to test Dycapo functionalities:
- admin 
- driver1
- rider1

All of them with password set to "password".

ADJUST DYCAPO.WSGI
***************
Change the lines
sys.path.append('/home/bodom_lx/Projects/')
sys.path.append('/home/bodom_lx/Projects/dycapo')
according to your Dycapo path

ADJUST AUTH.WSGI
***************
Change the lines
sys.path.append('/home/bodom_lx/Projects/')
sys.path.append('/home/bodom_lx/Projects/dycapo')
according to your Dycapo path

DATABASE FILE PERMISSIONS
***************
If you're using Sqlite (we don't recommend this, as it easily locks), then 
change the permissions of
- db/database.db
AND
- db/

To 777.

CONFIGURE APACHE
***************
Dycapo is designed and thought for using it with Apache2, and served with
mod_wsgi. It uses rpc4django <http://www.davidfischer.name/rpc4django/> to 
handle XML-RPC requests and responses. 
Authentication is based on basic access authentication (on HTTP and HTTPS)
Authentication is also handled by auth.wsgi file. Other authentication systems
will not work, even the classical Django admin login.
We highly reccommend to use HTTPS instead of HTTP, because of the private
information exchanged between Dycapo and the clients.

Please see docs/httpd.conf and docs/sites-enabled for some examples of 
basic Apache2 configuration for Dycapo.

CONFIGURE MOD.WSGI
***************
To let rpc4django write its logs, modify mod_wsgi configuration 
(/etc/apache2/mods-available/wsgi.conf for Debian systems).

Locate the lines

#WSGIRestrictStdin Off
#WSGIRestrictStdout Off
#WSGIRestrictSignal Off

And modify them in this way:

WSGIRestrictStdin On
WSGIRestrictStdout On
WSGIRestrictSignal On
